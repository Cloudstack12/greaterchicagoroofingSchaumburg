            </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <li>
                    Cleaning: Regular cleaning of skylights can prevent the buildup of dirt, grime, and debris, which can block natural light and reduce the skylight’s efficiency. Clean the skylight’s glass with a non-abrasive cleaner and a soft cloth.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>

                </li>
            </br>
                <li>
                    Sealing: Ensure that the skylight’s sealing is in good condition to prevent leaks. If there are any cracks or gaps in the sealing, they should be resealed promptly to avoid water damage.

                    <li>
                        Ventilation: Skylights require proper ventilation to prevent condensation and maintain air quality. Ensure the skylight has an adequate ventilation system, or consider installing one.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Energy Efficiency: Installing energy-efficient skylights or adding energy-saving features such as shading or low-e coatings can improve the skylight’s energy efficiency and reduce heating and cooling costs.
                    </li>
            </ul>
